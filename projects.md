A few things Iâ€™ve built, led, or contributed to â€” off the clock.

### **ArchitectureDoc AI**
*A machine learning-powered tool to tag and retrieve enterprise architecture docs.*

- OpenAI + Python
- Enterprise-ready tagging
- Built for work, shared for learning

GitHub Project: [https://github.com/shurtech/architecture-ai-assistant](https://github.com/shurtech/architecture-ai-assistant)

## Coming Soon

---

### **Cloud Enablement Toolkit**
Terraform modules + onboarding playbooks for spinning up new cloud projects across AWS and Azure.

---

### **Snowflake Data Migration**
High-throughput pipelines for secure migration of enterprise data. Jenkins, Prefect, and DBT made this fly.

More to come as I open-source and write things up.
