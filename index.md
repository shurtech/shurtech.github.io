  <h3>Solutions Architect | DevOps Engineer | Cloud Strategist</h3>
</div>

Welcome to **hurtuk.io** â€“ the digital home of Steve Hurtuk, a Solutions Architect with a decade of experience in IT engineering and deep roots in DevOps, data engineering, and cloud strategy.

By day, I lead cloud architecture and strategic planning at **Progressive Insurance**, serving as a Cloud Capability Leader across dozens of teams. My work spans secure, scalable infrastructure design using tools like **AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**, **Snowflake**, **Terraform**, **Kubernetes**, and **Kafka**.

With a background that spans **data engineering**, **systems automation**, and **event-driven architecture**, Iâ€™ve played key roles in enterprise transformations, platform standardization, and cloud migration initiatives. I thrive at the intersection of business value and technical innovation whre I build strong stakeholder relationships and guiding teams through complex problem-solving and implementation.

But this site? Itâ€™s about building something new.

As AI and machine learning reshape the future of tech, Iâ€™m diving in and learning from the ground up while sharing what I discover. Whether it's applying ML to different architecture projects, experimenting with LLMs, or building practical tools that bridge data and automation.
