  <h3>Solutions Architect | DevOps Engineer | Cloud Strategist</h3>
</div>

Welcome to **hurtuk.io** â€“ the digital home of Steve Hurtuk, a Solutions Architect with a decade of experience in IT engineering and deep roots in DevOps, data engineering, and cloud strategy.

By day, I lead cloud architecture and strategic planning at **Progressive Insurance**, serving as a Cloud Capability Leader across dozens of teams. My work spans secure, scalable infrastructure design using tools like **AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**, **Snowflake**, **Terraform**, **Kubernetes**, and **Kafka**.

But this site? Itâ€™s about building something new.

As AI and machine learning reshape the future of tech, Iâ€™m diving inâ€”learning from the ground up and sharing what I discover. Whether it's applying ML to different architecture projects, experimenting with LLMs, or building practical tools that bridge data and automation.
