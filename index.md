# Steve Hurtuk â€“ Solutions Architect | DevOps Engineer | Cloud Strategist

Welcome to **hurtuk.io** â€“ the professional space of Steve Hurtuk, a strategic-minded Solutions Architect with over a decade of experience in IT engineering and six years specializing in DevOps and cloud infrastructure.

I currently lead cloud architecture and strategic planning efforts at **Progressive Insurance**, where I serve as a Cloud Capability Leader and consult across dozens of teams. My focus is enabling secure, scalable, and efficient solutions using modern cloud technologies like **AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**, and **Snowflake**, with deep expertise in **Terraform**, **CI/CD**, **Kubernetes**, **Kafka**, and real-time data platforms.

With a background that spans **data engineering**, **systems automation**, and **event-driven architecture**, I've played key roles in enterprise transformations, platform standardization, and cloud migration initiatives. I thrive at the intersection of business value and technical innovationâ€”building strong stakeholder relationships and guiding teams through complex problem-solving and implementation.
