## About Me

I'm Steve Hurtuk, a Solutions Architect and longtime IT engineer whoâ€™s spent the last decade helping enterprise teams design cloud platforms, automate infrastructure, and build scalable data pipelines. But titles and tech stacks only tell part of the story.

Iâ€™ve always loved solving puzzles, digging into systems, and making things *work better*. Thatâ€™s what drew me to DevOps and platform engineering early on, and now itâ€™s whatâ€™s pulling me toward AI and machine learning. I believe weâ€™re at a turning point in tech and I donâ€™t want to just observe it. I want to contribute.

This site is where I document that shift. Itâ€™s a mix of technical projects, reflections, and experiments as I explore how AI and automation can reshape how we build and operate modern systems.
